# üöÄ My #100DaysOfCode Journey - Python Pro Bootcamp

**Hello and Welcome to my repository!** I am a **Computer Engineering student at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC)**, and I'm using this challenge to build a strong foundation in practical programming for the upcoming challenges. 

This is my progress log for Dr. Angela Yu's **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** course.

### Why This Challenge?

True learning comes from constant practice. My goal with this challenge is simple: **code every day that I'm able to** to bridge the gap between "knowing" and "doing," setting myself up for a successful career.

**Current Progress: Day 2 / 100**
